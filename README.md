# grbl-sim adapted (badly) for grbl-Mega-5X (5 axes)
1. Spindle probably won't work - I didn't need it to for my project
2. Axes A and B will output steps to file, however incorrectly (should only be used to verify something is happening)
3. There are probably 928475 other issues that I haven't found
4. I have pre-compiled the `grbl_sim.exe`, and I'm using a custom `simport.sh` (both are found in grbl_sim folder)
5. I won't be maintaining this, sorry :)
